Hello Becca! Here is the sample you sent me with a few edits! The visualization was made using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io).

## Our Demo

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**
